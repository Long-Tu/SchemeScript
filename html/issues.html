<h1>Known Issues</h1>

<p>
	Here is a list of known issues:
<ul>
	<li>Structural editing is highly experimental and has most certainly a
	  number of bugs.</li>
	<li>Starting with Eclipse 3.1, the console pages behave differently. The cursor
	    is not moved automatically at the end of the buffer. When a key is pressed, 
	    however, the cursor is moved at the end of the buffer. This has nothing
	    to do with SchemeScript, it is a <i>feature</i> of Eclipse 3.1.</li>
</ul>
</p>
