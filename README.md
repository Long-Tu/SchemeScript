SchemeScript
============

SchemeScript is a Scheme/Lisp editor plug-in for Eclipse.

The goal of this plug-in is to provide a robust Scheme/Lisp editor to the professional Scheme/Lisp developers who also happen to use Eclipse for Java programming. Also, the plug-in can be subclassed and extended to provide custom editors for Scheme/Lisp-based languages.

SchemeScript embeds the Kawa and SISC interpreters, and can be readily used to connect to the SISC REPL of SISCweb-based web applications.

The latest stable release is 1.3.0.rc1.
