<h1>SchemeScript User Guide</h1>

	The SchemeScript plug-in adds a powerful Scheme source 
	code editor to the Eclipse platform. 

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>
	The initial goal of this plug-in was to provide a robust, industrial-strength
	Scheme editor for the Eclipse platform. Eclipse is a state-of-the-art environment
	for Java development and is highly extensible. Unfortunately, at the time this
	project started, there was no good Scheme editor available. So we decided to
	write one. The main inspiration for SchemeScript is, of course, Emacs. But 
	also a few other proprietary Lisp editors the authors worked with.
</p>
<p>
	So the question is: what makes a good Scheme editor? The answer is simple: it
	must make Scheme programming fun, not tedious. Since Scheme source code is exclusively 
	made of S-expressions, it must be optimized for the editing and handling of S-expressions.
	The main ingredients are thus:
	<ul>
		<li>Parenthesis matching (of course) to highlight the corresponding 
			closing/opening parenthesis;</li>
		<li>Automatic indentation - indentation is what makes Scheme source code readable;</li>
		<li>S-expression-based movements/selection;</li>
		<li>Code completion;</li>
		<li>interaction with an interpreter.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p> 
	SchemeScript provides all this, and more. Also, almost all features are fully
	configurable, so one can adapt SchemeScript to its particular needs.
</p>
<h3>Non-goal</h3>
<p>
	The plug-in was not designed to provide all the features of a modern, complete development
	environment for Scheme, like well-integrated debugging tools, for instance. But it was
	designed to provide a basis for such tools. The plug-in can easily be integrated in 
	other plug-ins offering those features.

<h2><a name="configuration">Configuration</a></h2>
<p>
	All key sequences described in this document are fully configurable. To change 
	a key configuration:
	<ul>
		<li>open the Preferences page,</li>
		<li>select the Workbench/Keys section,</li>
		<li>select the "Scheme Editing" category in the "Command" section,</li>
		<li>choose the command name,</li>
		<li>add or remove key sequences.</li>
	</ul> 
</p>

<h2>Recent Changes</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>Version 1.0.0</b>
    	<ul>
    		<li> The evaluation can be interrupted if it is supported by the interpreter
				 (see the documentation for more details)
		    <li> Added an <i>interpreters</i> extension point, and a menu item to 
	            select the current interpreter
		    <li> Added an interpreter: Embedded Kawa. It is the Kawa interpreter
				 running inside the plug-in context/classpath. It comes with a 
				 stack trace viewer.
			<li> Added a <i>Kawa scratchpad</i> view (see the documentation for more
				 details and the examples subdirectory)
			<li> Structural editing commands (configurable and highly experimental/unstable)
			<li> new actions (add-require, expand-namespace expand-typename)
			<li> <code>define-namespace</code> clauses are processed for content assist
			<li> Bug fixes.
    	</ul>
	<li><b>Version 0.3.0</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a Scheme perspective, with menus, toolbar actions
			<li>Added integrated Scheme interpreter support
			<li>>Added fast eval keys
			<li>Bug fixes (parenthesis highlighting works even when the first
		     character of the file is an opening parenthesis,
			 renaming a file no longer breaks parenthesis highlighting,
		     pressing TAB on an already indented line no longer marks
		     the file as modified)
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Version 0.2.1</b>
		<ul>
			<li>The "Find Definition" action now opens the "Definitions" view
			<li>Added a "Find Symbol" action that pops up a dialog box for 	
			  querying a symbol definition
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Version 0.2.0</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Added a first version of the documentation
			<li>A new icon with transparent background
			<li>Bug fix: strings can now contain backslash characters (<code>\</code>)
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
