SchemeScript
============

SchemeScript is a Scheme/Lisp editor plug-in for Eclipse. It is part of the SchemeWay project.

The goal of this plug-in is to provide a robust Scheme/Lisp editor to the professional Scheme/Lisp developers who also happen to use Eclipse for Java programming. Also, the plug-in can be subclassed and extended to provide custom editors for Scheme/Lisp-based languages.

SchemeScript embeds the Kawa and SISC interpreters, and can be readily used to connect to the SISC REPL of SISCweb-based web applications.

The latest stable release is 1.2.15. The latest development release is 1.3.0 alpha 9. The latter can only be donwloaded from the Sourceforge download page, while the stable release can be installed using the Eclipse update site.
